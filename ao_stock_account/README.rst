AO-specific customizations on stock account
===========================================

This module contains customizations specific to Aleph Objects:

* Introduce the field *Last moved date* in product to help finding obsolete
  ones.
* Add a Quant view that computes the standard cost valuation. Note here that:

  - It does not support multicompany environments.
  - It only works with standard cost valuation.
  - It is not the biggest source of truth. Real valuation looks at accounting.
    This view only aims to help management in a standard cost strategy.
