============
CRM Helpdesk
============

Like records and processing of claims, Helpdesk and Support are good tools to
trace your interventions. This menu is more adapted to oral communication,
which is not necessarily related to a claim. Select a customer, add notes
and categorize your interventions with a channel and a priority level.

Bug Tracker
===========

Bugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues
<https://github.com/OCA/crm/issues>`_. In case of trouble, please
check there if your issue has already been reported. If you spotted it first,
help us smash it by providing detailed and welcomed feedback.
