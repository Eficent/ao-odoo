========================
CRM Helpdesk Button Open
========================

This module adds a button to open a draft Helpdesk ticket and assign the
current user as owner, as it occurred in v7. When the user presses the button
"Open" on a new Helpdesk Ticket, the status changes to "In Progress" and the
ticket is assigned to the user that pressed the button, provided that no
user was previously assigned.

This feature is important to helpdesk users because it allows them to
quickly take ownership of new tickets that have been reported by pressing
the "Open" button.

Usage
=====

Go to *Sales > Sales > Helpdesk and Support*, open a Ticket and click on
*Open* button.
