==============================================
MRP Production Calculate Cost Finished Product
==============================================

This module calculates the cost of the finished product on the basis of the
planned costs of the components that have been reserved for the
manufacturing order, and adds this cost to the finished product stock move &
associated quant.

The current module will only consider as cost of the finished product the
cost of the raw materials. Other modules can extend it to add other costs,
such as labor, machine, subcontracting, etc...
