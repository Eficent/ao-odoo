==========================
Accountant Read-Only Group
==========================

Odoo does not come with a read-only accountant group out of the box,
which is inconvenient when you need to have an external accountant go
through your accounting records in Odoo. This module adds a group
'Accountant Read-Only' so it's easy to grant an external accountant
access to your Odoo system. This group inherits the group 'Employee',
thus minimum level of create/write/delete rights will be granted for
some non-accounting related models.
